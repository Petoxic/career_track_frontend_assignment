# Setting up the project
Run a frontend application by executing:
```
  yarn install
  yarn start
```

After that, the application will be available in http://localhost:3000 <br/>

Run a backend application by executing:
```
docker-compose up
```

You will also need to initialize the database (first time you use it or any time you want to reset it to initial state), to do so run:
```
docker compose run --rm api npm run db:reset
```

After running the above commands, the API should be accessible onÂ http://localhost:3001/.

To clean up the backend application completely and start over, run:
```
docker compose down --remove-orphans
```
